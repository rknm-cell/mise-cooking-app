# Hybrid Conversation Flow Example

## How the Enhanced Recipe Generator Works

The hybrid approach combines structured recipe generation with conversational context. Here's how it works:

### 1. Initial Recipe Generation
```
User: "Make me a chicken stir fry"
→ generateObject() creates structured recipe
→ Recipe saved to database
→ Conversation history: [user: "Make me a chicken stir fry", assistant: "Generated recipe: Chicken Stir Fry"]
```

### 2. Recipe Modification
```
User: "Make it vegetarian"
→ generateObject() receives conversation context
→ AI understands this is a modification request
→ Creates new recipe with vegetarian ingredients
→ Recipe marked as modification
→ Conversation history updated
```

### 3. Follow-up Questions
```
User: "Can I use tofu instead of chicken?"
→ generateObject() with full conversation context
→ AI creates modified recipe with tofu
→ Shows modification badge and context
```

## Example Conversation Flow

### Round 1: Initial Request
**User Input:** "I want a quick pasta recipe"

**System Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "name": "Quick Garlic Pasta",
  "description": "A simple and delicious pasta dish ready in 15 minutes",
  "totalTime": "15 minutes",
  "servings": 2,
  "ingredients": ["8 oz spaghetti", "3 cloves garlic", "2 tbsp olive oil", "salt and pepper"],
  "instructions": ["Boil pasta", "Sauté garlic", "Combine and serve"],
  "storage": "Best served immediately",
  "nutrition": ["350 calories", "12g protein", "45g carbs"],
  "isModification": false
}
```

### Round 2: Modification Request
**User Input:** "Add some vegetables to it"

**System Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "def456",
  "name": "Quick Garlic Pasta with Vegetables",
  "description": "A simple and delicious pasta dish with fresh vegetables, ready in 20 minutes",
  "totalTime": "20 minutes",
  "servings": 2,
  "ingredients": ["8 oz spaghetti", "3 cloves garlic", "2 tbsp olive oil", "1 cup broccoli", "1 bell pepper", "salt and pepper"],
  "instructions": ["Boil pasta", "Sauté vegetables", "Sauté garlic", "Combine and serve"],
  "storage": "Best served immediately",
  "nutrition": ["420 calories", "15g protein", "55g carbs", "8g fiber"],
  "isModification": true,
  "conversationContext": "Based on conversation: Add some vegetables to it"
}
```

### Round 3: Further Modification
**User Input:** "Make it spicy"

**System Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "ghi789",
  "name": "Spicy Garlic Pasta with Vegetables",
  "description": "A spicy and delicious pasta dish with fresh vegetables and red pepper flakes, ready in 20 minutes",
  "totalTime": "20 minutes",
  "servings": 2,
  "ingredients": ["8 oz spaghetti", "3 cloves garlic", "2 tbsp olive oil", "1 cup broccoli", "1 bell pepper", "1 tsp red pepper flakes", "salt and pepper"],
  "instructions": ["Boil pasta", "Sauté vegetables", "Sauté garlic with red pepper flakes", "Combine and serve"],
  "storage": "Best served immediately",
  "nutrition": ["430 calories", "15g protein", "55g carbs", "8g fiber"],
  "isModification": true,
  "conversationContext": "Based on conversation: Make it spicy"
}
```

## Key Features
