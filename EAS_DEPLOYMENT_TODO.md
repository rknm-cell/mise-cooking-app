## **Phase 2: Authentication & API Setup (2 hours)**

### 2.1 Configure Production API (1 hour)
- [ ] **Deploy backend to Railway** (if not already deployed)
- [ ] **Create production environment variables** for API URL
- [ ] **Update API base URL** in frontend services to use production endpoint
- [ ] **Test authentication flow** with deployed backend

- [ ] **Add form validation** to auth forms with real-time feedback
- [ ] **Test auth persistence** across app restarts
- [ ] **Verify protected routes** work correctly
- [ ] **Add logout functionality** to profile modal
- [ ] **Add password reset functionality** (optional)

## **Phase 3: EAS Build Configuration (2 hours)**

### 3.1 Configure EAS Build (1 hour)
- [ ] **Install EAS CLI**: `npm install -g @expo/eas-cli`
- [ ] **Initialize EAS**: `eas build:configure`
- [ ] **Configure app.json** for production builds with proper metadata
- [ ] **Set up build profiles** for development, preview, and production
- [ ] **Configure app icons** and splash screen for production
- [ ] **Add app versioning** and build numbers

### 3.2 Environment Configuration (1 hour)
- [ ] **Create eas.json** with build profiles and environment variables
- [ ] **Configure API keys** for production builds
- [ ] **Set up environment-specific configs** for dev/staging/prod
- [ ] **Test build configuration** locally
- [ ] **Configure app signing** for iOS and Android
- [ ] **Set up build secrets** for sensitive data

## **Phase 4: Production Readiness (2 hours)**

### 4.1 Clean Up Development Code (1 hour)
- [ ] **Remove console.log statements** (from TODO.md priority 3)
- [ ] **Clean up unused imports** and components
- [ ] **Fix TypeScript errors** and warnings
- [ ] **Remove test screens** like `cooking-chat-test.tsx`
- [ ] **Update app metadata** (name, description, version)
- [ ] **Add proper error boundaries** for React components
- [ ] **Clean up development-only features**

### 4.2 Final Testing & Polish (1 hour)
- [ ] **Test complete user flow**: Auth ‚Üí Recipe Generation ‚Üí Cooking Session
- [ ] **Verify API connectivity** with production backend
- [ ] **Test offline functionality** for cached data
- [ ] **Polish UI/UX** - consistent spacing, colors, typography
- [ ] **Add app icons** and splash screen if needed
- [ ] **Test on both iOS and Android** simulators
- [ ] **Performance testing** - app launch time, navigation speed
- [ ] **Memory usage testing** - check for memory leaks

## **Phase 5: Deployment & Testing (Bonus - if time permits)**

### 5.1 EAS Build & Deploy (30 min)
- [ ] **Run EAS build** for both iOS and Android
- [ ] **Test build artifacts** on simulators/devices
- [ ] **Configure app store metadata** (descriptions, screenshots)
- [ ] **Set up internal testing** distribution

### 5.2 Post-Deployment (30 min)
- [ ] **Monitor app performance** and error rates
- [ ] **Test production API** under load
- [ ] **Verify user authentication** works in production
- [ ] **Check app store compliance** requirements

## **üîß Technical Details for Each Task**

### **TTS Disable Implementation:**
- Keep `services/text-to-speech.ts` file but add feature flag
- Keep `components/cooking/TTSControls.tsx` file but don't import/use it
- Add `TTS_ENABLED: false` to `constants/Config.ts`
- Wrap all TTS calls with feature flag check

### **API Configuration:**
- Create `constants/ApiConfig.ts` with environment-specific URLs
- Update all service files to use the new config
- Add proper error handling for network failures

### **EAS Configuration:**
- Create `eas.json` with proper build profiles
- Configure environment variables for different build types
- Set up app signing certificates

## **üìã Success Criteria**

### **By the end of 8 hours:**
- [ ] Recipe session works smoothly without TTS
- [ ] Authentication flows work with production API
- [ ] App builds successfully with EAS
- [ ] All console logs removed from production code
- [ ] Complete user journey tested and working
- [ ] App ready for app store submission

## **üöÄ Priority Order**

1. **Start with TTS disable** (quick win, immediate UI improvement)
2. **Polish Recipe Session UI** (core user experience)
3. **Configure Production API** (foundational for deployment)
4. **Set up EAS Build** (required for deployment)
5. **Clean up code** (production readiness)
6. **Final testing** (quality assurance)

## **üìù Notes**

- Each task should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Create feature branches for each major phase
- Update documentation as you make changes
- Keep track of time spent on each phase
- Test on both iOS and Android throughout the process
