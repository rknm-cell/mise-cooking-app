# Mise Cooking App - Cursor Rules

## Core Documentation
- **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Feature requirements and user stories
- **ENGINEERING_SPEC.md** - Technical architecture and implementation details

## Key Guidelines
1. Check PROJECT_SPEC.md for feature requirements before making changes
2. Update ENGINEERING_SPEC.md when technical implementation changes
3. Follow established patterns in the codebase
4. Use TypeScript for all components and functions
5. Test on both iOS and Android platforms

## Architecture
- Frontend: React Native + Expo with NativeWind styling
- Backend: Bun + Express.js with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for recipe generation
- Camera: Expo Camera for real-time processing

## File Structure
- `/app` - Expo Router pages
- `/components` - Reusable React Native components
- `/backend` - Express.js server with routes and database
- `/services` - API service functions



Keep documentation updated as the codebase evolves.
